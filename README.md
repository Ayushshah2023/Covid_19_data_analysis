# Covid_19_data_analysis
This is a project based on data analysis of the data from Covid19India.org API and applying some plots and analysis they missed while making the wabsite

This repository consists of many files, I will try to tell each file's summary:
1) Comparing_2_districts -> It will help you compare the active,total,cured and death cases of 2 districts from the same state or a different state
this will also give a bar plot for the same

Along with this If you enter the State:
It will show the top 3 states from recovereed states,recovery_percentage,active,active_percentage,death and death_percentage
It will show you for both the state

2)covid_19_india.csv -> this is the main database that will have the daily update of every state 

3)Figure_1 -> Example of the first file

4) Graphs_of -> This will give the graphs of bar graph comparision between 2 districts and along with this we get a graph of no.of tests, no.of.cured,no.of.active and no.of.death per day as a line graph
All of this has been MISSEd by the website

5) map -> THis is an image of our map for showing stress on which state have maximium effect of CoronaVirus

6) StateWise -> This will give you state wise distribution

7) Updating the database -> Just run this to update the databases

8) Folder called States -> This will contain data for every state
(IF you download this and run then remove this from the folder and keep it in the same place as the python files)
